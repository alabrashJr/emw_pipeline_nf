A group of 10 students from various schools participated in the workshop.Thirteen-year-old Saatvika Vedula enjoyed it, she said.

It spread across the world in just weeks. Impacting millions of lives.\nInventors across the world scrambled to make devices to help combat nasty mosquitos.\nDid you know?

The engineer's office was next to a lake buzzing with millions of mosquitos. They were fed up with being bitten all summer, sometimes getting ill from their bites.

It's perfect for clearing your home of all annoying and dangerous flying pests!\nIt\u2019s stylish, easy to control and it can clear your home of dirty flies and dangerous mosquitos!People are using them to live 'mosquito free' without harmful chemicals\u00a0\u00a0- the results are incredible...\nHow does it work?\nThe design is both innovative and very effective.Instead of trying to keep the mosquitos away, it actually attracts them, then catches and kills them!It lures the flies and mosquitos near using a safe, completely harmless UV phototaxis thermotaxis inducing light - translation: The flying pests can't resist it!Next to the UV-PT light is a powerful, yet efficient reverse fan that sucks the insects through a 1-way trapdoor. Once trapped in the drying basket they are dried to death by the fan a matter of 2mins. (They die without moisture.)\nYou can simply empty the dead bugs into the trash, without even touching them.\nNo mosquitos = No bites for you!We were surprised by how\u00a0easy it is to set up;Plug in - and away you go! No need for batteries or any chemicals. Almost silent when operating.See Mosquitron in action:\nHow Much Does It Cost? That\u2019s what we all want to know, right? It's now discounted down to $89 (from $179.99), which might seem steep at first. But when you consider most devices need regular, expensive refills and don't work for more than 10mins, this is a pretty good deal. In fact, competitor products using the same UV technology are priced at over $250!Plus it actually works!\u00a0When you look at the rise in mosquito viruses and diseases and the death toll, then $89 seems like a good deal for peace of mind that you are protected...\nWe think the price is a fair one to keep yourself bite free and healthy.\u00a0How To Buy a Mosquitron?\nThat\u2019s super easy. You can\nMosquitron Trap Benefits and Technology...\nDoes Mosquitron Really Work In Real Life?\nWe had some of our staff try it out in their homes. The results speak for themselves:\n\"We get a LOT of flies and mosquitoes in the warm months. It means you can't sit outside in the evenings without being eaten alive and your food is crawling with dirty flies.\nWe used to use citronella candles. They did work a bit, the problem is these candles burnout after 15mins and the kids hate the strong smell of them. Now we set up our Mosquitron nearby when we eat outside in the evening. The results are amazing - no flies, no mosquitos bothering us. We can finally enjoy outside eating again!\" - Michelle Vietto\n\"Mosquitos are a problem living in a hot, wet climate. We did use 2 of those liquid chemical\u00a0repellents in our bedroom when sleeping. My wife would complain she had a headache in the mornings whenever we used them. Now we use our Mosquitron, and we wake up bite and headache free!\" - Shane Maguire\n\"After suffering two bouts of badly infected mosquito bites last year, I was willing to try anything. This Mosquitron really works and you don't have to worry about breathing any nasty chemicals.\" - Jake Shearer\nConclusion: Is it worth it?\nIn short, yes! It really attracts and traps flies and mosquitos. Our staff tested it and loved it. The standout features for our reviewers were:- No hazardous chemicals or smelly scents\u00a0- Very quiet- Easy to use- Doesn't require recharging or replacing parts- Looks stylish and modern- Lightweight and portable (just needs a USB battery source)- Low energy useBottom line: If flies or mosquitos and their viruses and diseases are a problem where you live, then this is a solution better than candles and sprays!\nHow To Get A Mosquitron?\nNow that you are aware of this amazing new anti-pest device, and if it\u2019s still in stock, here is how to get one:\u00a0We recommend ordering a genuine \u00a0for cheapest from the .\nPROMOTION:\u00a0Now with 50% off and with free shipping for a limited time!\n* Special Offer Now $89\u00a0vs $178.99 - for Online Shoppers ONLY! - available while stocks last.\n\u00a9 2018 All Rights Reserved. |  |  |"},"OLast_modified_date":"Fri Jun 28 15:53:35 2019","OCreated_date":"Fri Jun 28 15:53:35 2019"},{"hashing":"22\/d16d02","processes":"Submitted process","class_name":"placeTagger","class_number":"10","Odir":"\/Users\/abdulrhmanalabrash\/Documents\/TEST\/work\/22\/d16d02135c0619734b989849219e7d\/demo11.clean.placeTagger.json","Opreview":[{"identifier":"demo11.html","title":"Science and the everyday life - The Hindu","length":3759,"text":"Science and the everyday life\nJanuary 16, 2019 15:58 IST\nJanuary 16, 2019 15:58 IST\nJanuary 16, 2019 15:58 IST\nJanuary 16, 2019 15:58 IST\nAt a workshop children learnt the practical aspect of science in their day to day life\nSomehow the science lessons in school do not automatically translate into practical application of its formulae and theories. Trying to bridge this gap is the city-based BookMagic Library. A four-day science workshop was recently hosted by the library in association with Science Utsav, an Bengaluru-based organisation that conducts interactive learning workshops. A group of 10 students from various schools participated in the workshop.Thirteen-year-old Saatvika Vedula enjoyed it, she said. Engrossed in making a sound box from a plastic container, she explained the concept of positive and negative terminals to her friend. \u201cThe trial and error method of learning is so interesting. It helps me understand the scientific concepts clearly and makes learning fun,\u201d she said.Hosted for children from class II to class VIII, the workshop is the brainchild of Hari Madala, owner of BookMagic Library. \u201cI realised that not many students in the city have access to the practical implementation of scientific theories in school. They just memorise the lessons without any knowledge about its application. That is when the idea of interactive science workshops occurred to me,\u201d he said. While the older kids tried to make their music box work, the younger ones in the room were busy making a scribbling robot with a plastic ball, cardboard cylinder and three sketch pens. The robot is designed to move in circles and make interesting patterns. \u201cChildren take these models home and we encourage them to break them and make them again so that they improvise in that process and learn something new,\u201d added Hari. The workshop encouraged children to observe science at work in their everyday surroundings and make their models with material that was easily available. Topics like electricity, motion, vibrations, the positive and negative terminal of a battery and working of a motor were covered in the workshop. According to Amala Reddy, Head of Science, Utsav \u2014 Visakhapatnam, the activities were crafted according to the curriculum. \u201cDifferent methodology is followed for different age groups. For children between the age of five years to 10 years, we first conduct the experiment and then explain the theory. However, for children above 10 years of age, we first teach them the theory and then go to the experiments,\u201d explained Amala. She started with Science Utsav in 2017 and has regularly held these workshops. Not just here but also in Vizianagaram and Srikakulam. This is not the first time the library is hosting such workshops. \u201cApart from the science workshop, we are also conducting Math workshop this winter. We had conducted such activities in last Summer and during Dasera vacations for which we received good feedback,\u201d said Madala.\nComments will be moderated by The Hindu editorial team.\nComments that are abusive, personal, incendiary or irrelevant cannot be published.\nPlease write complete sentences.

At least 12 people, mostly militants, have been killed in the missile strike,\" said a local intelligence official. \"The targeted site was a militant training camp.\"\nA senior security official confirmed the death toll, and said four missiles were fired from unmanned planes in the remote area.\nAll seven strikes this year have hit North Waziristan, a bastion of al-Qaeda fighters, the Taliban and the Haqqani network which launches attacks on the 113,000 US and Nato troops fighting the Taliban in neighbouring Afghanistan.\nThe administration of US President Barack Obama has put Pakistan at the heart of its fight against al-Qaeda and Islamist extremists and says the war in Afghanistan cannot be won without Islamabad's help, but tensions simmer.\nThe strikes fuel anti-American sentiment in the Muslim nation and draw public condemnation from the government, but a US senator on Wednesday scolded Islamabad for privately supporting strikes while publicly denouncing them.\n\"What troubles me is the public attack on these drone attacks when at the same time they've privately obviously not told us that we must stop,\" said Senator Carl Levin, chairman of the US Senate Armed Services Committee.\nPakistan's leaders \"not only understand and acquiesce, but in many cases privately support the drone attacks,\" Levin said, adding that \"the minimum we should expect is a silence on their part rather than a public attack on us.\"\nOn Wednesday, Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said that the controversial drone strikes were a source of tensions with Washington.\nThe United States is increasing pressure on Islamabad to tackle militants who use its soil to launch attacks in Afghanistan and American officials have said that the highly secretive drone programme has eliminated some top fighters.\nMore than 700 people have died in drone strikes since August 2008.\nStay updated on the go with  Android & iOS .  to download it for your device.\nGrameenphone:Type START  BR and send SMS it to 22222\nRobi:Type START  BR and send SMS it to 2222\nBanglalink:Type START  BR and send SMS it to 2225\nIn case you missed it\nMultimedia you may like\n\u00a9 2018 \/  | Powered By:\nCopyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action."},{"city":"Washington","address":"Washington, D.C., USA","lat":38.8950092,"lon":-77.0365625},{"city":"Islamabad","address":"\u0648\u0641\u0627\u0642\u06cc \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0627\u0644\u062d\u06a9\u0648\u0645\u062a \u0627\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0622\u0628\u0627\u062f, \u067e\u0627\u06a9\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646","lat":33.63573935,"lon":72.9230467028},{"city":"North","address":"Norge, R\u00f8yrvik, Tr\u00f8ndelag, Norge","lat":64.5731537,"lon":11.5280364395},{"city":"Levin","address":"Levin, Horowhenua District, Manawatu-Wanganui, 5510, New Zealand \/ Aotearoa","lat":-40.6218161,"lon":175.2865854}],"OLast_modified_date":"Fri Jun 28 15:53:35 2019","OCreated_date":"Fri Jun 28 15:53:35 2019"},{"hashing":"2c\/be38f5","processes":"Submitted process","class_name":"classifier","class_number":"12","Odir":"\/Users\/abdulrhmanalabrash\/Documents\/TEST\/work\/2c\/be38f575201f8ab9d316567cc82ef0\/demo4.clean.classifier.json","Opreview":{"identifier":"demo4.html","title":"rmer Union minister CP Joshi elected speaker of Rajasthan assembly | India News - Times of India","length":2072,"text":"+||HI, LOGOUTSign InNotification CenterIndia +  \/  \/ Former Union minister CP Joshi elected speaker of Rajasthan assemblyTop Searches:Former Union minister CP Joshi elected speaker of Rajasthan assemblyPTI | Jan 16, 2019, 14:15 ISTJAIPUR: Former Union minister\nJoshi was elected unopposed the speaker of the 15th  on Wednesday.\nCongress legislator from , was named for the post by the party's top leadership.\nCongress veteran took over the chair relieving protem speaker  after the House passed the motion moved for his election by a .\nJoshi was the MP from Bhilwara in the 15th Lok Sahba and had served as the Union minister for road transport and Highways and Panchayati Raj from 2009 to 2013.\nJoshi has been appointed as chief whip of the party, while Mahendra Choudhary the deputy chief whip.\nDownload The Times of India  for Latest .\nReadPost a commentAll Comments ()+^ Back to TopCharacters Remaining: 3000Continue without loginorLogin from existing accountFacebookGoogleEmailShare on FacebookShare on TwitterRefrain from posting comments that are obscene, defamatory or inflammatory, and do not indulge in personal attacks, name calling or inciting hatred against any community.

To cater to those with a sweet tooth, some of the insects are coated in chocolate.\nA bar marketed as being high in protein \u2013 as well as crickets \u2013 sells for \u00a5700 (HK$50.60), while a packet of salted crickets is \u00a51,300.\nToshiyuki Tomoda installed the machine in November outside his balloon shop in the city of Kumamoto because he was curious about the appeal of edible insects, the SoraNews24 website reported. He was shocked when it sold more than 500 packets in its first month.\nTomoda said the crickets tasted similar to shellfish and were best enjoyed \u201cwith a bit of mayonnaise or a dash of red pepper\u201d, although the giant water bugs were probably left to people with adventurous palates.\nShoichi Uchiyama, who works in publishing, has for years been advocating the joys of eating insects, saying they are a nutritious answer to the world\u2019s worsening food shortages.\nUchiyama, who regularly holds insect-tasting sessions for the curious, points out it takes vast areas of land and huge resources to raise cattle for beef, while insects consume the things humans will not touch and can be raised in much smaller spaces.\nInsects have been consumed for centuries, with huge spiders considered a delicacy in parts of South America and water bugs popular in Thailand. Uchiyama says he has tried most of the approximately 1,000 species of insects that are considered edible.

It challenges the cheap Islamophobic stereotype that Muslims cannot be universalists, non-dualists, or mystics. \u201cThe Light is one, the lampshades are many\u201d, invites comparison with Ramakrishna\u2019s metaphor of the many paths leading to the top of a mountain \u2014 while you are struggling and sweating it out on your chosen path, the other paths look very different, some forbiddingly so, the others extending a hand of invitation and welcome.\nYet, from the vantage point of the summit, all paths are the same.\nI love the neither\/nor logic of Rumi\u2019s rejection of all identity labels. So often, especially in a world polarised and divided on religious and communal lines as never before, labels are all important \u2014 \u201cI am this sect of\u2014\u201d, we proclaim with badge-flaunting arrogance, marginalising the Other that happens to be part of another sect of the same faith, or worse yet (tauba, tauba), a member of THAT religion.\nRumi refuses to be boxed in to any faith label, including Islam \u2014 the \u201cbox of cold words\u201d, a coffin. What does Rumi mean when he argues that the coffin is the labeller\u2019s coffin too? One possible interpretation: When I \u201cbox\u201d in the Other, I am also \u201cboxed\u201d in \u2014 a symbiotic dance that locks the labeller into his\/her own label. Perhaps this refurbished Hegelian dance of self and other, lies behind the popular dictum that when I point a finger at the Other, the four other fingers point back at me.\nRumi moves beyond faith labels to any other kind of label: Fast forwarding to the 21st century, this could include limiting of any kind that freeze frames one into an identity \u2014 an identity based on religion, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, caste, class or race.\nRumi goes beyond identity to geographies of \u201cplacement\u201d and settled habitation in any sense.\nHence: \u201cdo not belong to any land, or to any known or unknown sea. Nature cannot own or claim me, nor can Heaven.\u201d\nThe question arises, particularly in our current context of diasporic and reverse diasporic migration, refugee migration and more: Can one ever claim to be \u201cplaceless\u201d? Surely, we are \u201cthrown\u201d as Heidegger would have it (a brutally expressive metaphor), not \u201cmerely\u2019 into \u201cthe world\u201d, but also into a specific life world by virtue of birth and conditioning?\nYet, our own unsettled diasporic consciousness points to a portal beyond the entrapment in any given life world. Our \u201cthrownness\u201d is challenged gently or forcefully disrupted by exposure to multiple lifestyles and value systems.\nEven if one can remain in a frozen single culture frame (that old style ethnographers used to love about the tribal cultures that they dissected with colonial zest), one is still exposed to other cultures, with flows of attraction, love-hate and plain repulsion toward their mores, via TV and the internet.\nThus, at least \u201cin theory\u201d, one can certainly visualise \u201cplacelessness\u201d as one\u2019s \u201cplace\u201d in Rumi\u2019s imaging, more so today than in his time.\nFew in Hinduism or any other faith, have expressed the idea of non-duality (Advaita), with such simple poetic eloquence: \u201cI am that cat, this stone, no one. I have thrown duality away like an old dishrag.\u201d\nIn a paradoxical sense, when one is no-body, no label-able or place-able entity, one is also everybody and in all things \u2014 part of that cat, this stone, the lovers copulating with desperate urgency on the beach, hoping to reach climax before the cops show up, the dog urinating on the tombstone, and the putrefying remains in the grave.\nOf course, one could and perhaps should argue that such sentiments are hardly unique to Rumi. Advaita Vedanta is an obvious parallel, but one can also find resonant expressions in other Sufis.\nOur very own Kabir comes close, as does Bulleh Shah.\nConsider these lines from Bulleh Shah:\nThe day before, Bulleh Shah was an atheist\/He worshipped idols yesterday\/Bulleh loves the Muslim and salutes the Hindu\/I know not who I am\/I am neither a believer going to the mosque, nor a non-believer\/I am neither among sinners, nor among saints\/I belong neither to water, fire, nor air\/I know not who I am\/Nor am I born of Adam and Eve\/I have given myself no name\u00a0\u2014 Bulleh Shah: The Mystic Muse tr. K.S. Duggal\nBulleh adds a few more dimensions to Rumi\u2019s \u201cneither\/nor\u201d: He invokes the elements earth, air, fire and water, and claims he does not belong to any member of that set. There is also an explicit rejection of the ancestry of Adam and Eve, claimed by the Judaeo-Christian and Islamic traditions.\nMost controversial: He goes beyond the theism\/atheism binary. For many, that may be more challenging than Rumi\u2019s lines. The real existential challenge\/tease for all of us is: How willing are we to resist\u00a0the pseudo-comfort of memetic and conditioned labels?"},"OLast_modified_date":"Fri Jun 28 15:53:35 2019","OCreated_date":"Fri Jun 28 15:53:35 2019"},{"hashing":"8b\/ba97d9","processes":"Submitted process","class_name":"DTC","class_number":"14","Odir":"\/Users\/abdulrhmanalabrash\/Documents\/TEST\/work\/8b\/ba97d980b22690ffc3e3a06e258936\/demo5.DTC.json","Opreview":{"identifier":"demo5.html","publish data":"Wed Jan 16 00:00:00 EET 2019"},"OLast_modified_date":"Fri Jun 28 15:53:35 2019","OCreated_date":"Fri Jun 28 15:53:35 2019"},{"hashing":"77\/086efb","processes":"Submitted process","class_name":"temporalTagger","class_number":"14","Odir":"\/Users\/abdulrhmanalabrash\/Documents\/TEST\/work\/77\/086efb01a86b366de6c048b4b59b8f\/demo13.clean.temporalTagger.json","Opreview":{"identifier":"demo13.html","title":"YouTube clarifies rules on pranks as risky memes rage - The Hindu","length":3667,"text":"YouTube clarifies rules on pranks as risky memes rage\nJanuary 16, 2019 12:36 IST\nJanuary 16, 2019 12:38 IST\nDon't try this at home: A \u201cBird Box\u201d thriller released on Netflix a month ago inspired a challenge for people to do things blindfolded\nJanuary 16, 2019 12:36 IST\nJanuary 16, 2019 12:38 IST\nAccounts that post videos violating policies on pranks will get a \u201cstrike\u201d that will limit some features such as live streaming\nYouTube on Tuesday clarified rules against posting videos of dangerous pranks, as risky \u201cchallenges\u201d prompt people to video themselves doing things like biting into laundry soap or driving blindfolded.The company already forbid content inciting dangerous activities likely to result in serious harm.But the clarifications \u201cmake it clear that challenges like the Tide pod challenge or the Fire challenge, that can cause death and\/or have caused death in some instances, have no place on YouTube,\u201d the company said in a blog post.\u201cWe've made it clear that our policies prohibiting harmful and dangerous content also extend to pranks with a perceived danger of serious physical injury,\u201d said YouTube, which like other social networks is trying to show that it is better tackling problematic content.It made clear the updated policies ban pranks that trick people into thinking they are in danger, such as fake home invasions or drive-by shootings.\u201cYouTube is home to many beloved viral challenges and pranks, like Jimmy Kimmel's 'Terrible Christmas Presents' prank or the water bottle flip challenge,\u201d said YouTube, owned by Google's parent Alphabet.\u201cThat said, we've always had policies to make sure what's funny doesn't cross the line into also being harmful or dangerous.\u201dWhile playful or goofy challenges or pranks have become raging trends online, with video shared at YouTube or Facebook, some \u201cmemes\u201d have put people in jeopardy.A \u201cFire Challenge\u201d dared people to put flammable liquid on their bodies then ignite it, while a \u201cTide Pod Challenge\u201d involved people, typically teens, biting or chewing the encapsulated candy-colored laundry detergent.A \u201cBird Box\u201d thriller released on Netflix a month ago inspired a challenge for people to do things blindfolded, mimicking characters in the original streaming film.A US teenager over the weekend crashed while driving with her eyes covered, taking part in a challenge inspired by the hit Netflix show, according to media reports.YouTube policy also bans pranks that cause children trauma, for example the fake death of a parent or severe abandonment, according to the firm.Accounts that post videos violating policies on pranks will get a \u201cstrike\u201d that will limit some features such as live streaming.A second strike within three months will result in even more limited use of YouTube, while accounts getting three strikes in that time period will be terminated.\nComments will be moderated by The Hindu editorial team.\nComments that are abusive, personal, incendiary or irrelevant cannot be published.\nPlease write complete sentences.

A holy dip at Sangam is believed to lead the devotees towards the atonement of their sins and it frees a person from the cycle of death and birth. The Ardh Kumbh, which has been renamed as Kumbh this time, falls every six years. (Photo | Pushkar V \/ EPS)\nThe morning at Sangam on Tuesday came alive as early as 4 am with temperatures keeping around five degrees and a huge rush of devotees in groups and processions moving towards banks of the confluence presenting nothing short of a visual and spiritual delight to all those who became a testimony to the first shahi snan. (Photo | Pushkar V \/ EPS)\n'The magnitude of this year's Kumbh has gone up several notches. Besides the Mela area going up from 1,400 hectares to 3,600 hectare, the budget has gone up to Rs 4,300 crore from last time's Rs 1,200 crore,' said a senior official of religious affairs department. This time, this largest congregation of humanity on earth is likely to witness nearly 15 crore people thronging it from across the globe in the next 50 days. (Photo | Pushkar V \/ EPS)\nThe mystique of morning blended with devotion presented a unique experience to imbibe in as sadhus of 13 akharas -- seven Shaiv, three Vishnava, two udasin and one Sikh -- started moving, marching, dancing and singing one by one towards the bathing ghats for the shahi snan amid the chanting of hymns and shlokas. (Photo | Pushkar V \/ EPS)\nHuge processions of all 13 akharas (orders), taking part in the Kumbh, were the first ones to reach the confluence at eight am from early morning one by one as per the time allocated to them for shahi snan. Besides, lakhs of other devotees also thronged the Sangam in large numbers to take the holy dip on Makarsankranti marking the planetary transition of Sun. (Photo | Pushkar V \/ EPS)\nThe order of bathing for different akharas is pre-determined. It commenced with Mahanrivani and Atal Akhara, Niranjani with Ananada Akahra and Juna with Avahana and Agni akharas. They are followed by Nirvani, Digmabar, Nirmohi, baga Udasin, naya Udasin and Sikh akhara. Cynosure of the day was the procession of Naga sadhus, the amrtial order of seers who move naked with ash smeared all over. (Photo | Pushkar V \/ EPS)\nThe rest five shahi snans will take place on January 21 (Paush Porrima), February 4 (Mauni Amavasya), February 10 (Basant Panchami), February 19 (Maghi Poornima), March 4 (Mahashivratri).

The blast happened before lunch in a crowded section of the shopping arcade, and three of the victims were children, provincial police chief Juma Gul Himat told Reuters by phone.  President Hamid Karzai strongly condemned the explosion in Deh Rawud district, which his office said killed 16.  But a spokesman for NATO-led forces in Afghanistan and a senior Afghan army officer in Uruzgan, General Abdul Hameed, both put the toll at 20.  \u201cThe bomber had explosives attached to a waistcoat. He was spotted by a guard of the money market which is inside the bazaar and then he blew himself up, killing 20 civilians including the guard,\u201d Hameed told Reuters by phone.  The interior ministry said the bomber\u2019s target was not clear.  The Taliban regularly uses suicide attacks as weapons, mostly aimed at foreign or government troops, but because they often detonate in residential areas non-combatants are frequently the victims, the United Nations said in a recent report.  It listed as among the most deadly a truck bomb in Kandahar that reportedly failed to reach its planned destination and detonated in a residential area, killing at least 46 civilians.  A suicide bomber also killed 10 civilians in an Uruzgan market in November, when his vest exploded after he was fired on by troops. He was trying to attack a convoy of Afghan security forces at the time.  The overall number of civilians killed by anti-government forces in 2009 rose 40 percent from a year earlier to more than 1,600, the U.N. report said.  The number of non-combatants who died last year at the hands of NATO-led and government security forces fell by around a quarter, after a strong push by Western military leaders to cut back on the human cost of their presence in Afghanistan.  Related CoverageBut 2009 was still the deadliest overall for both civilians and foreign troops since the ouster of the Taliban by U.S.-backed Afghan forces in 2001, despite a rising influx of NATO-led trying to turn the tide against the insurgency.  This year has also been bloody, with 22 foreign troops killed so far. Fighting, which usually abates once heavy snowfalls arrive, has continued because of an unusually mild winter.

Trying to bridge this gap is the city-based BookMagic Library. A four-day science workshop was recently hosted by the library in association with Science Utsav, an Bengaluru-based organisation that conducts interactive learning workshops. A group of 10 students from various schools participated in the workshop.Thirteen-year-old Saatvika Vedula enjoyed it, she said. Engrossed in making a sound box from a plastic container, she explained the concept of positive and negative terminals to her friend. \u201cThe trial and error method of learning is so interesting. It helps me understand the scientific concepts clearly and makes learning fun,\u201d she said.Hosted for children from class II to class VIII, the workshop is the brainchild of Hari Madala, owner of BookMagic Library. \u201cI realised that not many students in the city have access to the practical implementation of scientific theories in school. They just memorise the lessons without any knowledge about its application. That is when the idea of interactive science workshops occurred to me,\u201d he said. While the older kids tried to make their music box work, the younger ones in the room were busy making a scribbling robot with a plastic ball, cardboard cylinder and three sketch pens. The robot is designed to move in circles and make interesting patterns. \u201cChildren take these models home and we encourage them to break them and make them again so that they improvise in that process and learn something new,\u201d added Hari. The workshop encouraged children to observe science at work in their everyday surroundings and make their models with material that was easily available. Topics like electricity, motion, vibrations, the positive and negative terminal of a battery and working of a motor were covered in the workshop. According to Amala Reddy, Head of Science, Utsav \u2014 Visakhapatnam, the activities were crafted according to the curriculum. \u201cDifferent methodology is followed for different age groups. For children between the age of five years to 10 years, we first conduct the experiment and then explain the theory. However, for children above 10 years of age, we first teach them the theory and then go to the experiments,\u201d explained Amala. She started with Science Utsav in 2017 and has regularly held these workshops. Not just here but also in Vizianagaram and Srikakulam. This is not the first time the library is hosting such workshops. \u201cApart from the science workshop, we are also conducting Math workshop this winter.

A holy dip at Sangam is believed to lead the devotees towards the atonement of their sins and it frees a person from the cycle of death and birth. The Ardh Kumbh, which has been renamed as Kumbh this time, falls every six years. (Photo | Pushkar V \/ EPS)\nThe morning at Sangam on Tuesday came alive as early as 4 am with temperatures keeping around five degrees and a huge rush of devotees in groups and processions moving towards banks of the confluence presenting nothing short of a visual and spiritual delight to all those who became a testimony to the first shahi snan. (Photo | Pushkar V \/ EPS)\n'The magnitude of this year's Kumbh has gone up several notches. Besides the Mela area going up from 1,400 hectares to 3,600 hectare, the budget has gone up to Rs 4,300 crore from last time's Rs 1,200 crore,' said a senior official of religious affairs department. This time, this largest congregation of humanity on earth is likely to witness nearly 15 crore people thronging it from across the globe in the next 50 days. (Photo | Pushkar V \/ EPS)\nThe mystique of morning blended with devotion presented a unique experience to imbibe in as sadhus of 13 akharas -- seven Shaiv, three Vishnava, two udasin and one Sikh -- started moving, marching, dancing and singing one by one towards the bathing ghats for the shahi snan amid the chanting of hymns and shlokas. (Photo | Pushkar V \/ EPS)\nHuge processions of all 13 akharas (orders), taking part in the Kumbh, were the first ones to reach the confluence at eight am from early morning one by one as per the time allocated to them for shahi snan. Besides, lakhs of other devotees also thronged the Sangam in large numbers to take the holy dip on Makarsankranti marking the planetary transition of Sun. (Photo | Pushkar V \/ EPS)\nThe order of bathing for different akharas is pre-determined. It commenced with Mahanrivani and Atal Akhara, Niranjani with Ananada Akahra and Juna with Avahana and Agni akharas. They are followed by Nirvani, Digmabar, Nirmohi, baga Udasin, naya Udasin and Sikh akhara. Cynosure of the day was the procession of Naga sadhus, the amrtial order of seers who move naked with ash smeared all over. (Photo | Pushkar V \/ EPS)\nThe rest five shahi snans will take place on January 21 (Paush Porrima), February 4 (Mauni Amavasya), February 10 (Basant Panchami), February 19 (Maghi Poornima), March 4 (Mahashivratri).

No Congress ministers are resigning. No MLAs from Congress or JD(S) will resign and shift to BJP. It is not going to happen. This nuisance has been created by the BJP,\" Kumaraswamy said.\nAsserting that the ruling Congress-JD(S) coalition was \"stable and strong\", he said his MLAs will not fall for the offer made by the saffron party, adding that the current crisis will \"fizzle out\" in a day or two.\n\"My government is stable. Congress and JD(S) are together. We will be together even in the LoK Sabha elections,\" Kumaraswamy said.\nAttacking the BJP for trying to destablise the Karnataka government, the JD(S) leader sought to know why the saffron party has holed up its 104 MLAs in a resort in Gurgaon, Haryana at a time when the southern state was reeling under severe drought in 165 taluks.\n\"BJP has exposed itself before the nation how desperately it wants to come back to power. They have made a fool of themselves before people. They have made a mockery of our democracy by offering huge amount to some of our JD(S) MLAs,\" he said.\nKumaraswamy also alleged that the BJP was \"misleading\" people with \"false information\" through media, especially local electronic channels.\nIn the 224-member state assembly, BJP has 104 members, Congress-79, JDS 37, BSP, KPJP and Independent one each, besides Speaker.\nDownload The Times of India  for Latest .\nReadPost a commentAll Comments ()+^ Back to TopCharacters Remaining: 3000Continue without loginorLogin from existing accountFacebookGoogleEmailShare on FacebookShare on TwitterRefrain from posting comments that are obscene, defamatory or inflammatory, and do not indulge in personal attacks, name calling or inciting hatred against any community.

(Image of current iPhone XS. Source: Reuters)\n\u2019s iPhone 11 or iPhone XI or the iPhone 2019 as it is being called, has already sparked a lot of interest, even though it won\u2019t be officially revealed till September 2019.\nWe have seen quite a few image renders of the supposed iPhone XI and the latest one from Onleaks (in partnership with a website called CompareRaja) claims to show an entirely different design from what was seen earlier.\nThe latest iPhone 2019 render shows a notch on the front display, which is smaller in size and the camera bump is\u00a0slimmer at the back. The camera bump is now in the centre and horizontally aligned, and not vertical one we have seen on previous iPhone variants. Apple is expected to introduce three cameras at the back with the iPhone XI.\nAn earlier Apple\u2019s iPhone XI render done by OnLeaks in partnership with Digit India had shown a rather hideous looking camera bump at the back of the device. Of course, these are all prototype renders and the iPhone XI will probably look very different when it actually launches.\nMeanwhile, an earlier report on\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0said the iPhone XI will have a triple camera, though this will be reserved for the more expensive 6.5-inch iPhone variant. The smaller\u00a05.8-inch screen iPhone XI variant will not get the triple camera, and stick with dual cameras.\nThe report also talked about how Apple will have only OLED display iPhones by 2020, something which has been discussed previously as well. With the triple camera system, Apple is expected to introduce a Time of Flight (ToF) sensor at the back as well.\nHere comes your very first and very early look at yet another 2019  prototype! Discover it right now through gorgeous 5K renders made on behalf of my Friends over  ->  (please read the full story in order to make educated comments\u2026)\n\u2014 Steve H.McFly (@OnLeaks)\nThe WSJ\u00a0report also added that the successor to the iPhone XR will have dual-cameras instead of a single camera system at the back.\nIt has been reported that the iPhone XR\u2019s sales have not lived up to expectations. Still Apple insists that the iPhone XR remains their best-selling model since it launched in October 2018."},"OLast_modified_date":"Fri Jun 28 15:53:35 2019","OCreated_date":"Fri Jun 28 15:53:35 2019"},{"hashing":"6b\/0342b4","processes":"Submitted process","class_name":"DTC","class_number":"7","Odir":"\/Users\/abdulrhmanalabrash\/Documents\/TEST\/work\/6b\/0342b4a5986a471e0b42a86846e204\/3.DTC.json","Opreview":{"identifier":"3.html","publish data":"null"},"OLast_modified_date":"Fri Jun 28 15:53:35 2019","OCreated_date":"Fri Jun 28 15:53:35 2019"},{"hashing":"c0\/c349fc","processes":"Submitted process","class_name":"placeTagger","class_number":"8","Odir":"\/Users\/abdulrhmanalabrash\/Documents\/TEST\/work\/c0\/c349fc864a2c815f9358f40f183d43\/demo12.clean.placeTagger.json","Opreview":[{"identifier":"demo12.html","title":"This Creative New Device Traps Mosquitos Without Chemicals","length":5349,"text":"Zika Outbreak Breeds New Anti-Mosquito Trap(And Its Pretty Awesome...)\nJan 12, 2018 | Advertorial\nDon't risk being exposed to the world's most deadly animal...\nLast year's dramatic Zika outbreak showed the world just how dangerous Mosquitos can be...\nThe Zika virus seemed to come from nowhere.

The blast happened before lunch in a crowded section of the shopping arcade, and three of the victims were children, provincial police chief Juma Gul Himat told Reuters by phone.  President Hamid Karzai strongly condemned the explosion in Deh Rawud district, which his office said killed 16.  But a spokesman for NATO-led forces in Afghanistan and a senior Afghan army officer in Uruzgan, General Abdul Hameed, both put the toll at 20.  \u201cThe bomber had explosives attached to a waistcoat. He was spotted by a guard of the money market which is inside the bazaar and then he blew himself up, killing 20 civilians including the guard,\u201d Hameed told Reuters by phone.  The interior ministry said the bomber\u2019s target was not clear.  The Taliban regularly uses suicide attacks as weapons, mostly aimed at foreign or government troops, but because they often detonate in residential areas non-combatants are frequently the victims, the United Nations said in a recent report.  It listed as among the most deadly a truck bomb in Kandahar that reportedly failed to reach its planned destination and detonated in a residential area, killing at least 46 civilians.  A suicide bomber also killed 10 civilians in an Uruzgan market in November, when his vest exploded after he was fired on by troops. He was trying to attack a convoy of Afghan security forces at the time.  The overall number of civilians killed by anti-government forces in 2009 rose 40 percent from a year earlier to more than 1,600, the U.N. report said.  The number of non-combatants who died last year at the hands of NATO-led and government security forces fell by around a quarter, after a strong push by Western military leaders to cut back on the human cost of their presence in Afghanistan.  Related CoverageBut 2009 was still the deadliest overall for both civilians and foreign troops since the ouster of the Taliban by U.S.-backed Afghan forces in 2001, despite a rising influx of NATO-led trying to turn the tide against the insurgency.  This year has also been bloody, with 22 foreign troops killed so far. Fighting, which usually abates once heavy snowfalls arrive, has continued because of an unusually mild winter.
